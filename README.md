# AutonomousSailingBoat
The goal of this project is to transform an RC sailboat into an autonomous sailboat using an Arduino Mega (Coding Language C++), compass module, GPS, ultrasonic sensor, and a custom ballast system. This project is to be then donated to a community boating center to facilitate STEM education and to inspire students to pursue engineering careers.

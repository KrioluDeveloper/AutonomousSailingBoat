# AutonomousSailingBoat
The goal of this project is to transform an RC sailboat into an autonomous sailboat using an Arduino Mega (Coding Language C++), compass module, GPS, ultrasonic sensor, and a custom ballast system. This project is to be then donated to a community boating center to facilitate STEM education and to inspire students to pursue engineering careers. 

The project prioritized establishing reliable mechanical, electrical, and software systems. Comprehensive documentation was created to aid lesson plan development and effective teaching for a diverse range of age groups. Educational engagement with the youth of CBC started in August, cultivating interest in robotics, engineering, and programming.

6/16/22 Autonomous+Sailing+Boat rev Tyler Rose and Andrew Chin 8/12/2023

This program contains code for programming an autonomous sailing boat 
using information from the BoatCodeStarterWind+GPS+Compass rev 5/31/2015
Â© 2014-2015 RoboSail, Waypoint custom class by CPARKTX Wind Sensor, GPS module and Compass/Accelerometer.
For detailed information about getting input from the WindSensor, GPS, Compass,
input from the RC receiver, and sending output to the Servos,
Program values are displayed to the Serial Monitor when the 
variable "verbose" is set to true.  otherwise set verbose to false.
Wind data is displayed in degrees with irons wind = 0, 
and GPS data is calculated and displayed as relative (x,y)
position from start on powerup.
